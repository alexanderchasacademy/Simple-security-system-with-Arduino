# Simple Security System with Arduino

## Overview

This project implements a simple motion-based security system using an Arduino microcontroller. It serves as a personal learning experience to practice project planning, embedded development, and working with real-world hardware components.

### Features:
- A PIR motion sensor to detect movement  
- A buzzer to signal an alarm  
- An I2C LCD screen for user feedback  
- Two LEDs to indicate system states (e.g., armed/disarmed)  
- A keypad for arming/disarming the system with a password  
- Serial and/or Wi-Fi logging using the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi  

The goal is to strengthen skills in embedded programming, hardware interfacing, and overall project execution. From design to deployment.
